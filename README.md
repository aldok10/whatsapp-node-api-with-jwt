## [](https://gitlab.com/aldo_k/whatsapp-node-api-with-jwt#why)Why?

  

The main reason I decided to build this is that there are many developers who want to play around with Whatsapp API and use them in personal applications before getting/purchasing a Whatsapp Business Account API officially from Whatsapp.
